# Maze-Project
For this project, write a C program that will find its way through a maze using the depth-first search algorithm.You will traverse the maze and collect coins until you reach the destination or decide there is no path to the destination.This program takes input from a file where the filename is specified in the command line arguments.The input file will alwaysbe thesame format: The first three lines containtwo integer values per line while the rest of the lines contain two integers and a character value per line:•The first valid line gives the size of the 2-D maze(the number of rows given by the first number, then the number of columns given by the second number), valid values are >= 1•The second valid line gives the coordinates of the starting position in the maze•The third valid line gives the coordinates of theending position in the maze•The remaining valid lines in the file give the coordinates of positions that are either blocked or contain “coins”oThe blocked positions are marked by letter ‘b’ in input fileoThe positions containing coins are marked by letter‘c’ in input fileIf the command line arguments do not contain a valid filename, you should print an error message and quit the program.  This could be because there was not a name given or the name given did not match that of a valid file.  If the command line arguments contain multiple file names, give an error message stating that too many names were given and quit.“Too many input files.\n”The followingshows an example of an input file.  The coordinates are given with the row listed first and the column listed second.A maze of NxM has rows numbered from 1 to Nand columns number from 1 to M.The “types” are given as a single character after the coordinates.10201 110205 1b4 2b3 3c1 10b2 9b5 13 c3 8b4 7b5 6b6 5c7 4b8 3c
